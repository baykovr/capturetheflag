WARNING: 
Many TCP clients like to retransmit packets 
if they do not receive a reply, for example our scanner 
will. Unloading the module mid defense is not recommended,
even if an initial attack is blocked.

Incoming packets are hooked at NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING, 
If the incoming packet is TCP destined for port 54321 
and is greater than 160 bytes, we assume this is a 
buffer overflow attempt and issue NF_DROP and print
a massage to kernel log, view with dmesg.

Regular traffic may pass unharmed NF_ACCEPT. 
We also print the IP and payload size of whoever 
sends benign traffic. 

Oh, this will also detect nmap's half open SYN scan,
watch for the benign message with a very small
packet size.
